# ReactSpringPractice
This is the weekend project which React library and Spring framework for Java are used.
This project created via npx create-react-app command from terminal for the frontend side. For the backend I use spring initalizer to create java spring project. In order to show my work I did not upload dependent files which comes from npm and spring framework.
